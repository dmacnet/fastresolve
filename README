   Fastresolve is a package of programs to process web log files to
   get DNS and domain ownership information for log analysis. It sends
   out many queries in parallel, and caches results, for speed. Its
   DNS resolver is about 10 times as fast as logresolve.pl from the
   Apache 1.3.9 distribution, and about 50 times as fast as
   logresolve.c from that distribution. When last tested, it is 5-20
   times as fast as the adnslogres program that comes with the adns
   library, and about 3 times as fast as jdresolve, which is a Perl
   program that uses similar algorithms (https://github.com/jdrowell/jdresolve).
   
   Fastresolve is written in C++ and Perl. Versions of it have been tested
   on GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris.
   
   Fastresolve consists of the following programs:
   
   dns-terror
          Reads log files, resolves the IP addresses that are resolvable,
          and optionally writes the results back out. Optionally it reads
          and saves the results in a DB file.
          
   reresolve
          Makes another pass trying to resolve unresolved IP addresses in
          a DB file, using dns-terror.
          
   convert-ip-db
          Converts the DB file written by dns-terror into an ASCII Analog
          DNS cache file. This is an alternative to rewriting the (huge)
          log files with the IP addresses resolved in them. On the other
          hand, Analog then has to do lookups from its big DNS cache
          file.
          
   getdominfo
          Reads a list of host names, from either log files or a DB file,
          and queries a whois database for the organizations that own
          their domains. Writes the results to a second DB file.
          
   convert-dom-db
          Converts the DB file written by getdominfo into ASCII Analog
          config directives.
          
   make-report
          Runs the above programs and Analog to produce a web report.
          
   rebuild-ip-db
          
   rebuild-dom-db
          Recreate the DB files from the ASCII files written by the
          convert-* scripts, for recovering from corrupted DB files.
          
   expire-ip-db
          Removes old entries from the DB file written by dns-terror.
          
   Fastresolve requires the following:
   
   Perl.
          Any version 5 from the last few years should work.
          
   A C++ compiler.
          A recent version supporting the Standard Template Library is
          required. Clang, EGCS, GCC 2.95, or other recent GCC should
          work. (GCC 2.7.x is not recent enough; its support for
          exceptions is buggy.)
          
   The Berkeley DB library, version 2.x-5.x.
          It's probably best to get the latest (2.x, 3.x, 4.x, or 5.x) version.
          The DB library must be configured with --enable-cxx in order to
          support the C++ interface.

   The Perl BerkeleyDB module.
          
   ADNS, an asynchronous resolver library. (http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~ian/adns/)
          Fastresolve comes with a patch to apply to ADNS to improve
          performance.
          
   zlib, a compression library.
          Version 1.0.6 or newer is required.
          
   Analog 3.0 or later.
          Needed by make-report. If you use convert-dom-db then Analog
          4.03 or later is recommended, because it fixes a performance
          problem when reading large numbers of SUBDOMAIN commands.
