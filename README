   Fastresolve is a package of programs to process web log files to get
   DNS and domain ownership information for log analysis. It sends out
   many queries in parallel, and caches results, for speed. Its DNS
   resolver is about 10 times as fast as logresolve.pl from the Apache
   1.3.9 distribution, and about 50 times as fast as logresolve.c from
   that distribution. It is 5-20 times as fast as the adnslogres program
   that comes with the adns library, and about 3 times as fast as
   [4]jdresolve, which is a Perl program that uses similar algorithms.
   
   Fastresolve is written in C++ and Perl. Versions of it have been tested
   on Linux-Mandrake 7.0-8.2, BSDI BSD/OS 4.0.1-4.3, FreeBSD 4.2-4.7,
   and Solaris 2.6-8 (sparc).
   
   Fastresolve consists of the following programs:
   
   [5]dns-terror
          Reads log files, resolves the IP addresses that are resolvable,
          and optionally writes the results back out. Optionally it reads
          and saves the results in a DB file.
          
   [6]reresolve
          Makes another pass trying to resolve unresolved IP addresses in
          a DB file, using dns-terror.
          
   [7]convert-ip-db
          Converts the DB file written by dns-terror into an ASCII Analog
          DNS cache file. This is an alternative to rewriting the (huge)
          log files with the IP addresses resolved in them. On the other
          hand, Analog then has to do lookups from its big DNS cache
          file.
          
   [8]getdominfo
          Reads a list of host names, from either log files or a DB file,
          and queries a whois database for the organizations that own
          their domains. Writes the results to a second DB file.
          
   [9]convert-dom-db
          Converts the DB file written by getdominfo into ASCII Analog
          config directives.
          
   [10]make-report
          Runs the above programs and Analog to produce a web report.
          
   [11]rebuild-ip-db
          
   [12]rebuild-dom-db
          Recreate the DB files from the ASCII files written by the
          convert-* scripts, for recovering from corrupted DB files.
          
   [13]expire-ip-db
          Removes old entries from the DB file written by dns-terror.
          
   Fastresolve requires the following:
   
   [14]Perl.
          Any version 5 from the last few years should work.
          
   A C++ compiler, such as [15]GCC.
          A recent version supporting the Standard Template Library is
          required. EGCS, GCC 2.95, or other recent GCC should work. (GCC
          2.7.x is not recent enough; its support for exceptions is
          buggy.)
          
   The [16]Berkeley DB library, version 2.x-4.x.
          It's probably best to get the latest (2.x, 3.x, or 4.x) version.
          The DB library must be configured with --enable-cxx in order to
          support the C++ interface. The version that comes with Linux
          glibc wasn't, so Linux users will need to supplement it. A
          suitable [17]RPM is available for both 2.x and 3.x. Make sure
          to install the Perl BerkeleyDB module compiled against a
          compatible version of DB.
          
   [18]ADNS, an asynchronous resolver library.
          Check for the latest version (1.0 as of this writing).
          Fastresolve comes with a patch to apply to ADNS to improve
          performance. An [19]RPM including the patch is available.
          
   [20]zlib, a compression library.
          Version 1.0.6 or newer is required.
          
   [21]Analog 3.0 or later.
          Needed by make-report. If you use convert-dom-db then Analog
          4.03 or later is recommended, because it fixes a performance
          problem when reading large numbers of SUBDOMAIN commands.
          
   Fastresolve was developed at [22]UUNET, a WorldCom company. It is
   distributed under [23]the GNU General Public License.
