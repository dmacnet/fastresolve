* Support Sleepycat Berkeley DB 4.x.

Changes in release 2.9:

* Replaced calls to the Perl DB_File package with calls to the Perl
  BerkeleyDB package, which on some systems is easier to link with
  the same version of Berkeley DB as fastresolve.
* make-report no longer does whois queries, because getdominfo has not been
  updated to query multiple registrars' whois servers.

  the IP address.

Changes in release 2.7:

* dns-terror can use the Berkeley DB 3.x C++ interface as an alternative to 2.x.
* dns-terror ignores NUL bytes in an IP address field, instead of crashing,
  and passes through NUL bytes elsewhere instead of truncating the log entry.
* getdominfo retries instead of exiting if it can't connect a whois socket.

Changes in release 2.6:

* Adjust to changes in whois server responses.
* adns patch updated for 0.8.

Changes in release 2.5:

* make-report produces gzipped log files with IP addresses resolved,
  as well as the Analog report.
* convert-dom-db works around an Analog 4.0 bug that rejects some
  valid SUBDOMAIN commands.
* adns patch updated for 0.7.
* A hopefully more reliable workaround for the "adns_wait hangs" problem.
* Now available in RPM format (both source and binary).

Changes in release 2.4:

* dns-terror prints the number of DB file cache hits.
* Added dns-terror -z option to gzip the output.
* Added a workaround in dns-terror to adns hanging on the last query.
* expire-ip-db creates its temp file in the same directory as the original.
* Added expire-ip-db -m option for a more concise progress report.

Changes in release 2.3:

* Added reresolve program.
* dns-terror error handling and progress messages were improved.
* dns-terror builds cleanly on Solaris.
* getdominfo uses a simpler, more robust correct approach to parallelism.
* getdominfo adjusted for the latest whois changes.
* expire-ip-db avoids DB file corruption.
* adns patch updated for 0.6.

Changes in release 2.2:

* Added dns-terror -f option to skip fields before IP address, to
  support IIS (W3C) log files.
* dns-terror added stats to show how many of the queries were successful.
* getdominfo isn't fooled by the new whois legal notice.
* rebuild-ip-db handles the values correctly.

Changes in release 2.1:

* Added dns-terror -r option to only read positive caches from DB file.
* Simplified Analog date handling code in convert-ip-db.
* Kludged around a problem generating the make-report man page.
