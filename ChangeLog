	Quote names of macro definitions as required by newer automake/aclocal.
	Add checks for Berkeley DB 5.x.
	* getdominfo.in, make-report.in: Support datarootdir added in newer Autoconf.
	* BoolString.h: Add const to stop gcc 4 warnings.
	* DatedStringdB.cc: Support Berkeley DB 5.x, with extra transaction parameter to Db::open.
	* dns-terror.cc (submit_query, process_answer, main): Add const to stop gcc 4 warnings.
